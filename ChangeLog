	10. T3D package requires has to be >= 2.3 version

MatrixAbstractLayer version 1.2 released May 14, 2007

	9. Added some messages to configure script.

	8. Added #include "configMal.h" in MatrixAbstractLayer.h".

	7. At Makefile.am MatrixAbstractLayerT3D.h have been added and
	configMal.h have been deleted.

	6. The typedef have been defined in the:
	MatrixAbstractLayerBoost.h
	MatrixAbstractLayerVNL.h
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallMatrix3x3Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallMatrix4x4Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallVector3Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallVector4Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerT3D.h.

	5. The file MatrixAbstractLayerT3D.h have been created. This file
	has the macros to allow the use of T3D has smallVector and
	smallMatrix. 
	- The MAL_S4x4_* have been implemented using T3D. 
	- The MAL_S3_VECTOR* have been implemented by V3D.
	- The MAL_S4_VECTOR* have been implementd by V3D.
	- The MAL_S3x3_* have been implemented by the default Matrix3x3
	implementation (PatternGeneratorJRL::Matrix3x3<double>) (It shoud
	be changed by the R3D implementation once it'd been created).

	4. The <> of the includes of MatrixAbstractLayerBoost.h have been
	replaced by "". 

	3. The new macros added in (2) have been implemented in
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallMatrix3x3Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallMatrix4x4Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallVector3Default.h,
	MatrixAbstractLayerSmallVector4Default.h.

	2. In MatrixAbstractLayerSmall.h have been added the documentation
	of five news macros to acces to the elements of a smallVector and
	of a smallMatrix: 
	MAL_S4x4_MATRIX_ACCESS_I(name,i),
	MAL_S4x4_MATRIX_ACCESS_I_J(name,i,j),
	MAL_S3x3_MATRIX_ACCESS_I(name,i),         
	MAL_S3x3_MATRIX_ACCESS_I_J(name,i,j), 
	MAL_S3_VECTOR_ACCESS(name, i).
	
	1. MatrixAbstractLayer.h have been modified to allow the choice of
	T3D,R3D and V3D as Smallmatrix and SmallVector implementation. The
	file have been simplified, now if not special SmallVector or
	SmallMatrix is selected then the SmallVector and the SmallMatrix
	by default are used so it's avoided the declaration of
	DEFAULT_VECTOR3D, DEFAULT_VECTOR4D, DEFAULT_MATRIX3x3 and
	DEFAULT_MATRIX4x4 and the use of configMal.h.
